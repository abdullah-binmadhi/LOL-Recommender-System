# Champion Analysis Report

I have generated a comprehensive analysis report based on the champion data found in `src/data/champions.json`.

## How to View the Report

1. Open the file `Champion_Analysis_Report.html` in your web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.).
2. The report includes:
   - An Executive Summary paragraph analyzing the data.
   - Key statistics (Total Champions, Most Common Role, etc.).
   - Interactive charts visualizing Class Distribution, Range Balance, and Difficulty.

## How to Save as PDF

Since I cannot generate a binary PDF file directly in this environment without external libraries, I have formatted the HTML report to be print-friendly.

To save it as a PDF:
1. Open `Champion_Analysis_Report.html` in your browser.
2. Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) to open the Print dialog.
3. Change the "Destination" or "Printer" to **"Save as PDF"**.
4. Click **Save**.

This will create a high-quality PDF document with all the analysis and graphs included.
