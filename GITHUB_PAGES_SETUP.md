# 🚀 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

Follow these steps to make your Champion Recommender live on GitHub Pages!

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Your project is already on GitHub
- ✅ You have push access to the repository

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Push the New Files

Make sure these files are in your GitHub repository:
- `index.html` (landing page)
- `src/index.html` (main app)
- `README.md` (project description)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages files"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Settings"** (top menu)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** (left sidebar)
4. **Under "Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. **Choose "main" branch** and **"/ (root)"** folder
6. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub will show a message: "Your site is ready to be published"
- Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment
- You'll get a URL like: `https://abdullah-binmadhi.github.io/LOL-Recommender-System`

### Step 4: Test Your Website

1. **Visit your GitHub Pages URL**
2. **Test the champion recommender**
3. **Try the CSV export** (Ctrl+Shift+E)
4. **Share the URL** with others!

## 🌐 Your Website URLs

### Main Website
```
https://abdullah-binmadhi.github.io/LOL-Recommender-System/
```

### Direct to Champion Recommender

## ✅ What Works on GitHub Pages

- ✅ **Full champion recommender functionality**
- ✅ **All 3 ML algorithms**
- ✅ **User registration and questionnaire**
- ✅ **CSV data export**
- ✅ **Responsive design**
- ✅ **Real-time results**

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ **No server-side data collection** (data stays in user's browser)
- ❌ **No centralized CSV file** (each user exports their own data)
- ❌ **No admin panel for viewing all users**

## 📊 How Data Works

### For Users:
1. **Fill out form** → Data saved to browser
2. **Complete questionnaire** → Results added to browser data
3. **Press Ctrl+Shift+E** → Download personal CSV file

### For You (Website Owner):
- Users can share their CSV files with you
- No automatic data collection
- Each user manages their own data

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Website Not Loading
- Check if GitHub Pages is enabled
- Verify files are in the main branch
- Wait a few minutes for deployment

### Features Not Working
- Check browser console for errors
- Try in different browsers
- Clear browser cache

### CSV Export Not Working
- Make sure user completed registration
- Try Ctrl+Shift+E keyboard shortcut
- Check if browser allows downloads

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Share your GitHub Pages URL** with friends
2. **Post on social media** or gaming communities
3. **Collect feedback** from users
4. **Consider upgrading** to full hosting for data collection

## 📈 Upgrade Options

If you want centralized data collection later:
- **Heroku** (free tier available)
- **Railway** (free tier)
- **Vercel** (free for static + serverless)

Your website will be live and shareable once GitHub Pages is set up! 🎉
