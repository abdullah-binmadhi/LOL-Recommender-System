# Archive Directory

This directory contains files that are no longer actively used in the project but are kept for historical purposes or potential future reference.

## Contents

This archive includes:
- Previous versions of the champion recommender HTML files
- Old JavaScript files that have been consolidated
- Development and testing files
- Configuration files from earlier development stages
- Duplicate or experimental implementations

## Note

These files are not needed for the current version of the application. They have been moved here to:
1. Keep the main repository clean and organized
2. Preserve historical work for reference
3. Avoid cluttering the main directories with unused files

If you need to access any of these files, you can find them here. However, the current production version of the application only uses the files in the `src/` directory.
