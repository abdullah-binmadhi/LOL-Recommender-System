# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python-based web application for League of Legends champion recommendations. The system will use a Python web framework (such as Flask or FastAPI) to serve a web interface where users answer questions about their playstyle preferences. A Python-based machine learning model will analyze their responses and recommend the most suitable champion from the League of Legends roster. The application will leverage an existing champion dataset and predefined questions to provide personalized recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a League of Legends player, I want to answer questions about my playstyle preferences, so that I can discover champions that match my preferred way of playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display a welcome screen with an option to start the recommendation process
2. WHEN a user starts the recommendation process THEN the system SHALL present questions one at a time in a clear, user-friendly interface
3. WHEN a user answers a question THEN the system SHALL save their response and proceed to the next question
4. WHEN a user completes all questions THEN the system SHALL process their responses and generate a champion recommendation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a League of Legends player, I want to receive a champion recommendation based on my answers, so that I can try playing a champion that suits my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes user responses THEN it SHALL use a machine learning model to analyze the answers
2. WHEN the ML model completes analysis THEN the system SHALL return the most suitable champion recommendation
3. WHEN a recommendation is generated THEN the system SHALL display the champion's name, image, and key characteristics
4. WHEN displaying a recommendation THEN the system SHALL explain why this champion was recommended based on the user's answers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a League of Legends player, I want to see detailed information about my recommended champion, so that I can understand their abilities and playstyle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a champion is recommended THEN the system SHALL display the champion's role, difficulty level, and primary attributes
2. WHEN displaying champion details THEN the system SHALL show the champion's abilities and brief descriptions
3. WHEN a user views a recommendation THEN the system SHALL provide tips on how to play the recommended champion
4. IF a user wants more information THEN the system SHALL provide links to external resources about the champion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a League of Legends player, I want to retake the questionnaire or get alternative recommendations, so that I can explore different champion options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives a recommendation THEN the system SHALL provide an option to retake the questionnaire
2. WHEN a user chooses to retake THEN the system SHALL reset their previous answers and start fresh
3. WHEN a user requests alternatives THEN the system SHALL provide 2-3 additional champion recommendations
4. WHEN displaying alternatives THEN the system SHALL show why each alternative champion was selected

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Python application to handle the champion dataset and questions efficiently, so that the recommendation system performs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python application starts THEN it SHALL load the champion dataset from CSV/JSON files successfully
2. WHEN the application loads questions THEN it SHALL validate that all required questions are available from the question dataset
3. WHEN the Python ML model processes data THEN it SHALL handle edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully using appropriate libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)
4. IF the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL log errors appropriately and display user-friendly error messages with recovery options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a League of Legends player, I want the website to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it on different devices and browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the website on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and usable
2. WHEN a user accesses the website on desktop THEN the interface SHALL utilize the available screen space effectively
3. WHEN a user navigates the website THEN it SHALL be accessible to users with disabilities following WCAG guidelines
4. WHEN the website loads THEN it SHALL perform well across modern web browsers
